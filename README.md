# AI Work Log Template

A zero-dependency, Markdown-first system to track work processes, decisions, outputs, failures, and context across **any** AI tools.

Goal: Full recall of what happened, data generated, and decisions made — pasteable into new chats whenever/wherever.

## Why this works
- Plain text → git-friendly, portable, no lock-in
- Structured IDs/tags → easy reference & search
- Selective pasting + summaries → fits any context window
- Works with Grok, Claude, Gemini, local LLMs, Cursor, etc.

## Quick Start
1. Copy `WORK-LOG-TEMPLATE.md` → rename to `YourName-Work-Log-2026.md` (or quarterly)
2. Paste the `INSTRUCTION-TEMPLATE.md` as your first message in **any** new AI chat
3. When resuming: copy last 5–15 days + key old IDs into new chat

## Features
- Reverse-chronological append-only
- Unique ID system (YYYYMMDD-tag)
- Hashtags: #decision #data #failure #insight #task
- Weekly summary workflow

Fork → customize → start logging!
