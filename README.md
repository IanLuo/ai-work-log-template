# AI Work Log Template

Simple, zero-dependency Markdown system to track decisions, outputs, experiments, failures, and context across **any** AI tools.

Goal: Full process awareness — recall what happened, data generated, and decisions made, pasteable into new chats whenever/wherever.

## Quick Start
1. Copy `WORK-LOG-TEMPLATE.md` → rename to something personal (e.g., `Ian-Work-Stream-2026.md`)
2. Paste the full content of `INSTRUCTION-TEMPLATE.md` as your **first message** in any new AI chat (Claude, Gemini, Grok, etc.)
3. When resuming a session: copy-paste the last 5–20 days of log entries (or a weekly summary) + key older IDs

## Features
- Reverse-chronological append-only format
- Unique IDs (YYYYMMDD-tag) for easy referencing
- Hashtags: #decision #data #failure #insight #task
- Built-in weekly/monthly summary workflow
- 100% plain text → git sync, offline, no lock-in

Fork this repo, customize, and start logging your AI-powered projects!
